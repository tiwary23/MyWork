                                <p class="content">The most important factors for a long life, I think, are partly in the genes; 
                                    number two is lifestyle, which includes healthy diet and regular exercise. 
                                    I walk, run and swim every day. However, I think too much exercise is also 
                                    unhealthy because of over-stress; sometimes people who exercise too many hours 
                                    per day die early.</p>

                                <p class="content"> Of course, the most important factor of all for long life is a good family. 
                                    When a person goes home with the wife or the kids giving him endless headaches, 
                                    then it's hard for that person to enjoy a long life. I am very fortunate, 
                                    because my wife Elizabeth and my obedient children are very good; they have 
                                    given me happiness.</p>

                                <p class="content">You really can't say enough about 'Blade Runner.' For that movie to have such a 
                                    long life - you can't describe what a beautiful feeling that is. 
                                    Initially, the movie was out of theaters in something like two weeks. 
                                    But the people that wanted it back - the fans - they really saved it.</p>
